The target of this application is to understand the decision tree inducers. When you learn the inducers you often get just an algorithm and a few examples. But sometimes it is helpful to get a complete calculation of an specific example to really understand the algorithms.

DeTrIn allows you to create decision trees with various properties. You can import your own examples and induce decision trees with different split- and stop-criteria and pruning methods.

After generating, the decision tree is displayed and you can get an explanation on every node or edge.

Finally, you can export the generated decision tree as a sample calculation.

If you miss a property item, you can easily extend the application by writing a plugin implementing the missing property.

## About

DeTrIn is the result of my master thesis 'Decision Tree Generation as an elearning-Module' which I wrote in 2011.
